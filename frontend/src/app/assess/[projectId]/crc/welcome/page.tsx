            <h2>What it is</h2>
            <p>
              Compliance Readiness Controls (CRC) are a custom built library of 137 actionable controls designed to prepare your
              organization for AI compliance and regulation. These controls are drawn from the EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF,
              ISO/IEC 42001, and other leading AI governance frameworks, then consolidated into a single, practical set of
              requirements that covers what you need across all of them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each control tells you exactly what needs to be in place, how to implement it, what documentation and
              artifacts are required, and what evidence you should be collecting. You assess your current state for each
              control by indicating whether you already have it in place, whether you are actively working toward it,
              whether it is planned for the future, or whether it does not apply to your system. You can also document your
              evidence, gaps, and action items directly alongside each control.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end, the platform scores your responses across all eight compliance domains and produces a readiness
              profile that shows where you stand, where the gaps are, and what to prioritize next.
            </p>

            <h2>How it does not work</h2>
            <p>
              This is a self assessment tool designed to guide your organization in preparing for AI compliance and
              regulation. It does not grant, certify, or guarantee compliance with any framework, standard, or law.
              Completing this assessment does not make your organization compliant. The controls are provided as guidance
              to help you understand what is expected, identify gaps, and build a plan toward readiness. Results depend
              entirely on the accuracy and honesty of your responses and how closely they reflect your actual policies,
              processes, and documentation. For formal compliance determination, consult qualified legal counsel or an
              accredited auditor.

            <h2>Why this is included in premium</h2>
            <p>
              Premium gives you a structured, repeatable compliance readiness assessment without maintaining your own
              spreadsheets, cross referencing multiple standards documents, or building a control library from scratch. You
              get a consistent methodology, stored assessments, and per category tracking each time you evaluate.
              Stakeholders can see exactly where your organization stands against real regulatory requirements, what gaps
              remain, and what to work on next.               This is a living assessment you return to as your program matures, not a
              one time checklist exercise.

              <li>
                Use plain language “The organization SHALL…” statements so every stakeholder, technical or not,
                understands what is required.
              </li>
              <li>
                Provide implementation guidance, step by step instructions, evidence requirements, artifact descriptions,
